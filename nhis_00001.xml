For analyses using the household as the unit of analysis (e.g., how many households contained a person who needed help with activities of daily living?), researchers should use the household weight.

PERWEIGHT represents the inverse probability of selection into the sample, adjusted for non-response with post-stratification adjustments for age, race/ethnicity, and sex using the Census Bureau's population control totals. For each year, the sum of these weights is equal to that year's civilian, non-institutionalized U.S. population.

There are instances, however, when the researcher should use a different person-level weight, particularly with supplements where a random adult or child family member was selected for questioning. For example, researchers analyzing variables from the sample adult/sample child supplements from 1997 forward should use SAMPWEIGHT rather than PERWEIGHT.

      <txt><![CDATA[SAMPWEIGHT is an IPUMS NHIS-constructed variable that represents, with a few exceptions, the random selection of a sample person in the household to complete a supplement survey.  (The exceptions to this generalization are the 1983 health insurance supplement and 1993 health insurance, access to care, and family resources supplements, which were asked of all persons in the second half of the year.)

For survey years 1997 forward, SAMPWEIGHT is based on the Final Annual Sample Adult and Sample Child Weights in the original NHIS public use files. This weight should be used with variables taken from the sample adult or sample child supplements for 1997 on (as indicated by the supplement title in the "Source" section toward the top of each variable description). 

SAMPWEIGHT also contains the sampling weights for a subset of the pre-1997 supplements, for which the definition of a sample person, and the rules governing the selection of sample persons, are less consistent. The universe statements for SAMPWEIGHT document who was included in the supplements requiring use of this weight on a year-by-year basis. SAMPWEIGHT consistently represents the inverse probability of selection into a supplement, adjusted for non-response with additional post-stratification adjustments for age, race/ethnicity, and sex using the Census Bureau's population control totals.

      <txt><![CDATA[FWEIGHT is a variable based on the Final Annual Weight in the original NHIS public use files. This weight should be used for many analyses at the family level, particularly with variables for which information was collected about family characteristics. 
&nbsp;Creating FWEIGHT requires using independent estimates of the number of families from a reliable source such as the U.S. Census Bureau in order to perform post-stratification adjustments in a manner similar to what was done for the person-level weights. However, such independent estimates do not exist. 

As a result, the NHIS used the "principle person" method to create family-level weights. The person weight with the smallest ratio adjustment within each family was used as a proxy for the family-level ratio adjustment. This method is believed to provide a more accurate estimate of the total number of U.S. families than either the use of other person weights within the family or the use of no ratio adjustments at all. Therefore, the Family weight contains factors for selection probabilities at the household level, household non-response adjustment, and several ratio adjustment factors that are applied to all person weights.Users  should review the documentation for extracted variables--most notably the "Weights" section toward the top of each variable description--to ascertain which weight is the appropriate choice for a given survey year.

      <labl>Educational attainment</labl>
      <txt><![CDATA[For sample adults (and, prior to 2019, for all persons aged 5 and older), EDUC reports the highest level of schooling an individual had completed, in terms of completed grades for persons with less than a high school degree, and in terms of degrees attained for high school graduates and those with higher education.  Respondents were handed a card listing recognized categories and asked to identify the correct category.

According to the Field Representative's Manuals for 1997-2000, only "regular schooling which advances a person toward an elementary or high school diploma, or a college/university/professional school (such as law, medicine, dentistry)" counted as education.  Schooling in settings other than "regular schools" counted only if the credits obtained were acceptable in a regular school system.  Thus, for example, "adult education" classes not taken for credit or for the attainment of a college degree did not count.  

For the end of high school, EDUC distinguishes between those who completed twelfth grade but did not attain a diploma (e.g., those who failed to pass state-mandated high school exit examinations), those who graduated from high school, and those passed the GED (General Equivalence Degree) Test (which certifies that the test taker has attained high school-level academic skills).  Persons who attained a high school diploma in less than twelve years were to be recorded as "high school graduates," a guideline consistent with EDUC's emphasis on degrees attained rather than years spent in the classroom.  The Field Representative's Manual for 1997-2000 directed interviewers to probe to determine whether persons who attended "post-graduate" high school classes but did not attend college had received a high school diploma.  

For nurses, interviewers were to determine whether training was received in a college or in a nursing school (with the grade completed at the last regular--non-nursing--school to be entered in the latter case).  For a person attending special education classes or a school for persons with mental, physical, or developmental difficulties, interviewers were to ask which grade in a regular school most closely matched the individual's education level.  Persons currently in school were generally assumed to have completed the previous grade.]]></txt>

      <txt><![CDATA[For sample adults aged 18+ (and all persons age 18+ in 2004-2018) who worked at a paid or unpaid job or business last week, held a seasonal or contract position last week, or were not working last week because they were on vacation, on family/maternity leave, unable to work for health reasons, HOURSWRK reports the total hours that the sample person worked in the past week. or in the past two weeks at all jobs/ businesses or at the main job/business. The universe and time period for HOURSWRK were somewhat different for 1979 and 1991. HOURSWORK reports total hours worked in the past two weeks for sample persons aged 17+ in 1979 who, during the past 2 weeks, worked, had a job or business from which they were temporarily absent, or looked for work or were on layoff; in 1991, HOURSWORK reports total work hours worked in the  past two weeks for sample persons aged 18+ in 1991 who were employed in the past 2 weeks and worked for a private company or the federal, state, or local government. Please refer to the Universe and Comparability tabs for more information about changes in the universe, time period, and the types of jobs included in HOURSWRK.

Beginning in 2019, sample adults aged 18+ who held a seasonal or contract position last week continued to be identified by NCHS as included in the universe for HOURSWORK, but were omitted from the HOURSWRK question and had their responses set to "Unknown - Not Ascertained."]]></txt>

      <txt><![CDATA[For sample persons aged 17 and older in 1977 and 1979, persons aged 14 and older in 1990-1996 who worked for at least one employer during the month prior to the interview, and sample persons aged 18 and older from 1997 forward who worked at a job or business last week or who did not work last week but worked in the last year, MONTHWRK indicates the number of months that the sample person had at least one job or business.

In 1993, this variable only included persons who were interviewed in quarters 3 and 4.
&nbsp;From 1990 to 1996, this variable is part of the Family Resources supplement that provides information on individuals' health benefits, amount of coverage and income received from employment, welfare benefits, public assistance, and savings. 

Questions in the Family Resources supplement are different from those in the core survey in terms of the content and the treatment of missing data. Questions in the Family Resources were normally asked of the month prior to the interview while the core survey asked of the last calendar year. All missing data in the Family Resources supplement were imputed by NHIS. Users can refer to the imputation flag variables JOBMOFLAG and JOBSELFMOFL to identify persons with imputed data.  

From 1990 to 1992, users can use JOBMOFLAG to identify persons who worked for at least one employer last month and whose information on the number of working months was imputed. From 1993 to 1996, users should use JOBMOFLAG to identify persons with imputed data who exclusively worked for an employer last month and JOBSELFMOFL to identify those with imputed data who worked for an employer and were also self-employed last month.For more information about other related variables, please use the IPUMS NHIS search function and drop-down menus.]]></txt>

      <txt><![CDATA[For sample adults and sample children, POVERTY reports the ratio of family income to the U.S. Census Bureau's poverty thresholds for the year in question. Prior to 2019, POVERTY was reported for all persons. The poverty status of a family group is assigned to each member of the family, thus making POVERTY a person-level variable. The ratio of income to the poverty threshold is also calculated for adults who live alone or with persons they are not related to; in such cases, POVERTY is based on the individual's income.

Values for POVERTY range from less than half of the poverty threshold for a family of a given size and age structure (i.e., with a given number of children under 18) to five or more times the poverty threshold for a family of a given size and age structure.  For families where the number of children under age 18 in the family is equivalent to the number of family members, family income is presumed to be nonexistent, and the ratio of such nonexistent income to the poverty line is undefinable (with a code of 98 in POVERTY).  

The ratio of family income to the official poverty threshold in POVERTY is available only for 1997 forward.  The dichotomous variable POORYN, which distinguishes persons with family income at or above the poverty threshold from persons with family income below the poverty threshold, is available for 1982 forward.  For detailed discussion of the basis of the Census Bureau's official poverty thresholds, users should consult the variable description for POORYN.]]></txt>

      <labl>Felt everything an effort, past 30 days (adults)</labl>
      <txt><![CDATA[AEFFORT reports responses to the question, "During the past 30 days, how often did you feel that everything was an effort?"   

The Field Representative's Manual for 1997-2000 stated that the meaning of "everything" was respondent defined. At the beginning of the section of the survey devoted to evaluating nonspecific psychological distress, interviewers stated, "Now I am going to ask you some questions about feelings you may have experienced over the past 30 days."  They then handed respondents a flashcard listing five categories (all of the time; most of the time; some of the time; a little of the time; none of the time), from which respondents were to select the appropriate response.  The Manual for 1997-2000 directed the interviewer to "reread the question, emphasizing the wording of the answer categories," if the respondent gave an answer that did not match these categories.

Related Variables

AEFFORT is one of a series of six variables whose responses can be summed as a scale measuring nonspecific psychological distress over a 30-day recall period.  This scale, developed by Ronald C. Kessler and known as the Kessler 6 Scale (K6), asks about six manifestations of nonspecific psychological distress.  
&nbsp;Kessler's instrument asks how often, during the past 30 days, the respondent felt:

So sad that nothing could cheer you up? (ASAD)

Nervous? (ANERVOUS)

Restless or fidgety? (ARESTLESS)

Hopeless? (AHOPELESS)

That everything was an effort? (AEFFORT)

Worthless? (AWORTHLESS)
As noted above, acceptable responses fell into five categories, ranging from "none of the time" to "all of the time."Scoring Variables&nbsp;Kessler recommends scoring the scale by assigning 0 to 4 points for each of the six questions, based on the reported frequency of the feelings (i.e., 0 for "none of the time"; 1 for "a little of the time"; 2 for "some of the time"; 3 for "most of the time"; and 4 for "all of the time").  The range for summed responses on the K6 Scale is thus 0 to 24, with 0 suggesting the lowest level of nonspecific psychological distress, and 24 suggesting the highest level of nonspecific psychological distress.  According to the scoring criteria proposed by Kessler, persons with a score of 13 or greater are likely to be experiencing severe mental illness.

To assist researchers who intend to sum responses to the variables included in the K6 Scale, IPUMS NHIS assigns codes that are consistent with Kessler's advised scoring system (i.e., with "none of the time" coded as 0 and "all of the time" coded as 4).  To produce valid results, users must exclude not in universe cases (persons other than sample adults, code 6 in IPUMS NHIS) and unknown cases (codes 7, 8, and 9 in IPUMS NHIS) before summing the responses.Follow-up Questions&nbsp;As a follow-up to the K6 Scale questions, the NHIS included a question that was not part of Kessler's original survey instrument.   All sample adults who answered "some of the time," "most of the time," or "all of the time" to any of the six questions included in the Kessler 6 Scale were asked, "Altogether, how much did these feelings interfere with your life or activities: a lot, some, a little, or not at all?" (AFEELINT1MO).   In 1999, additional follow-up questions collected further information about how "these feelings" affected the person (see FBADHOWOFT, FBADMORE, FBADLESS, FBADUNABLE, and FBADCUTDOWN).]]></txt>

      <txt><![CDATA[For sample adults who reported feeling sad, nervous, restless or fidgety, hopeless, worthless, or that everything was an effort at least "some of the time" during the past 30 days, AFEELINT1MO reports responses to the question, "Altogether, how much did these feelings interfere with your life or activities: a lot, some, a little, or not at all?" 

The indicators of sample adults' feelings used to determine who was asked this question were based on variables from the Kessler 6 Scale (K6), which was developed by Ronald C. Kessler to measure nonspecific psychological distress over a 30-day reference period.  Kessler's instrument asks how often, during the past 30 days, the respondent felt: 

So sad that nothing could cheer you up? (ASAD)

Nervous? (ANERVOUS)

Restless or fidgety? (ARESTLESS)

Hopeless? (AHOPELESS)

That everything was an effort? (AEFFORT)

Worthless? (AWORTHLESS)
For each of these questions, respondents selected one of the following responses listed on a flashcard: "none of the time," "a little of the time," "some of the time," "most of the time," "all of the time." 

Interviewers began by noting, "We just talked about a number of feelings you had during the past 30 days."  Sample adults who responded "some of the time," "most of the time," or "all of the time" to any of these questions were asked the aforementioned question about how such feelings interfered with their life or activities.   This follow-up question was not part of the tool designed by Kessler to measure nonspecific psychological distress or severe mental illness.]]></txt>

      <txt><![CDATA[AHOPELESS reports responses to the question, "During the past 30 days, how often did you feel hopeless?"   

At the beginning of the section of the survey devoted to evaluating nonspecific psychological distress, interviewers stated, "Now I am going to ask you some questions about feelings you may have experienced over the past 30 days."  They then handed respondents a flashcard listing five categories (all of the time; most of the time; some of the time; a little of the time; none of the time), from which respondents were to select the appropriate response.  The Field Representatives Manuals for 1997-2000 directed the interviewer to "reread the question, emphasizing the wording of the answer categories," if the respondent gave an answer that did not match these categories.

Related Variables

AHOPELESS is one of a series of six variables whose responses can be summed as a scale measuring nonspecific psychological distress over a 30-day recall period.  This scale, developed by Ronald C. Kessler and known as the Kessler 6 Scale (K6), asks about six manifestations of nonspecific psychological distress.  
&nbsp;Kessler's instrument asks how often, during the past 30 days, the respondent felt:

So sad that nothing could cheer you up? (ASAD)

Nervous? (ANERVOUS)

Restless or fidgety? (ARESTLESS)

Hopeless? (AHOPELESS)

That everything was an effort? (AEFFORT)

Worthless? (AWORTHLESS)
As noted above, acceptable responses fell into five categories, ranging from "none of the time" to "all of the time."Scoring Variables&nbsp;Kessler recommends scoring the scale by assigning 0 to 4 points for each of these six questions, based on the reported frequency of the feelings (i.e., 0 for "none of the time"; 1 for "a little of the time"; 2 for "some of the time"; 3 for "most of the time"; and 4 for "all of the time").  The range for summed responses on the K6 Scale is thus 0 to 24, with 0 suggesting the lowest level of nonspecific psychological distress, and 24 suggesting the highest level of nonspecific psychological distress.  According to the scoring criteria proposed by Kessler, persons with a score of 13 or greater are likely to be experiencing severe mental illness.

To assist researchers who intend to sum responses to the variables included in the K6 Scale, IPUMS NHIS assigns codes that are consistent with Kessler's advised scoring system (i.e., with "none of the time" coded as 0 and "all of the time" coded as 4).  To produce valid results, users must exclude not in universe cases (persons other than sample adults, code 6 in IPUMS NHIS) and unknown cases (codes 7, 8, and 9 in IPUMS NHIS) before summing the responses.Follow-up Questions&nbsp;As a follow-up to the K6 Scale questions, the NHIS included a question that was not part of Kessler's original survey instrument.   All sample adults who answered "some of the time," "most of the time," or "all of the time" to any of the six questions included in the Kessler 6 Scale were asked, "Altogether, how much did these feelings interfere with your life or activities: a lot, some, a little, or not at all?" (AFEELINT1MO).   In 1999, additional follow-up questions collected further information about how "these feelings" affected the person (see FBADHOWOFT, FBADMORE, FBADLESS, FBADUNABLE, and FBADCUTDOWN).]]></txt>
