### Data and Methodology

The data for this analysis come from the [Current Population Survey](https://cps.ipums.org/cps/) (CPS). CPS is a monthly survey run by the Census Bureau with questions about demographic and economic characteristics of the U.S. population. CPS is used to calculate the monthly federal statistics on unemployment. I obtain the data from the Integrated Public Use Microdata Series database [-@ipums2020]. 


My sample consists of CPS monthly core employment data for January 2020â€“March 2021. Each sample includes individual and household weights, which allow inferences about the population from the samples. I discuss CPS weights and examine the weight distribution in the [Appendix](#weights).
```{r include=FALSE}
library(ipumsr)
memory.limit(10000000)
ddi <- read_ipums_ddi("nhis_00001.xml")
data <- read_ipums_micro(ddi)
```


```{r}
library(sjlabelled)
library(tidyverse)
library(kableExtra)
library(formattable)
library(purrr)
library(zoo)

data <- data %>%
  remove_all_labels()
